Question: Given a binary tree, convert the binary tree to its Mirror tree.

Mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.     

code:
class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to convert a binary tree into its mirror tree.
    void mirror(Node* node) {
        // code here
         // code here
        if(node==NULL)
        return;
        swap(node->left,node->right);
        mirror(node->left);
        mirror(node->right);
    }
};

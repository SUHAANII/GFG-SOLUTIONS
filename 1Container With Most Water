question: Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers, where each element arr[i] represents the height of the vertical lines, find the maximum amount of water that can be contained between any two lines, together with the x-axis.

Note: In the case of a single vertical line it will not be able to hold water.

code;

class Solution {
  public:
    int maxWater(vector<int> &arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.size();
        int left = 0;
        int right = n-1;
        int maxArea = 0;
        
        while(left < right){
            maxArea = max(maxArea, (right-left) * min(arr[left],arr[right]));
            if(arr[left]<arr[right]){
                left++;
            }else{
                right--;
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
};

Question: Given a binary tree, find its height.

The height of a tree is defined as the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node. A leaf node is a node that does not have any children.

code:
class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to find the height of a binary tree.
    int height1(Node* node) {
    if(node==NULL) return 0;
         int left = height1(node->left);
         int right = height1(node->right);
         
         int ans = max(left,right)+1;
         return ans;
    }
  public:
    // Function to find the height of a binary tree.
    int height(Node* node) {
        
         int ans = height1(node);
         return ans-1;
    }
};

question: You are given two unsorted arrays a[] and b[]. Both arrays may contain duplicate elements. For each element in a[], your task is to count how many elements in b[] are less than or equal to that element.

code:

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to count how many elements in vector 'b' are less than or equal to each element in vector 'a'
    vector<int> countLessEq(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
        // Step 1: Sort vector 'b' to enable binary search
        sort(b.begin(), b.end());
        
        // Step 2: Create a vector to store the results
        vector<int> ans;
        
        // Step 3: Iterate through each element 'e' in vector 'a'
        for(auto &e : a) {
            // Step 4: Use upper_bound to find the first position in 'b' where elements are greater than 'e'
            // The difference between this position and the beginning of 'b' gives the count of elements <= 'e'
            ans.push_back(upper_bound(b.begin(), b.end(), e) - b.begin());
        }
        
        // Step 5: Return the result vector containing counts for each element in 'a'
        return ans;
    }
};

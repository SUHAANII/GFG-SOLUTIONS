question: Given a number represented as a string s (which may be very large), check whether it is divisible by 13 or not.

code:

int rem = 0; // Initialize a remainder variable to store the intermediate result

// Loop through each character in the string 's'
for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
    // Check if the current remainder is less than 13
    if (rem < 13) {
        // Update the remainder by shifting the previous digits left (multiply by 10)
        // and adding the numeric value of the current character
        // (s[i] - 48 converts the character to its integer value)
        rem = rem * 10 + (s[i] - 48);
    }
    // Update the remainder to be the remainder when divided by 13
    rem = rem % 13;
}

// Return true if the final remainder is 0, indicating that the number is divisible by 13
return rem == 0;

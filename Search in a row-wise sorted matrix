Question: Given a row-wise sorted 2D matrix mat[][] of size n x m and an integer x, find whether element x is present in the matrix.
Note: In a row-wise sorted matrix, each row is sorted in itself, i.e. for any i, j within bounds, mat[i][j] <= mat[i][j+1].

code: 
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to search a given number in a row-column sorted matrix.
    bool searchRowMatrix(vector<vector<int>> &mat, int x) {
        // Iterate through each row in the matrix
        for (vector<int> &row : mat) {
            // Perform binary search using lower_bound in the current row
            // lower_bound returns an iterator pointing to the first element 
            // that is not less than (i.e., greater than or equal to) x
            auto lb = lower_bound(row.begin(), row.end(), x) - row.begin();
            
            // Check if the found position is within the bounds of the row
            // and if the element at that position is equal to x
            if (lb != row.size() && row[lb] == x) 
                return true; // Return true if x is found in the current row
        }
        // If the target x is not found in any row, return false
        return false;
    }
};

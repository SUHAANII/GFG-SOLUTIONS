question: You are given an array citations[], where each element citations[i] represents the number of citations received by the ith paper of a researcher. You have to calculate the researcherâ€™s H-index.
The H-index is defined as the maximum value H, such that the researcher has published at least H papers, and all those papers have citation value greater than or equal to H.

code:

class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& cit) {
        // Step 1: Sort the citations in descending order
        sort(cit.rbegin(), cit.rend());
        
        int ans = 0; // Variable to store the maximum H-index found
        int n = cit.size(); // Get the number of citations
        
        // Step 2: Iterate through each citation
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Check if the current citation count is greater than or equal to (i + 1)
            // This means that there are at least (i + 1) papers with at least (i + 1) citations
            if(cit[i] >= i + 1) {
                ans = i + 1; // Update ans to (i + 1) if the condition is satisfied
            } 
            // If the current citation count is less than (i + 1), 
            // it means no further papers can satisfy the H-index condition
            else {
                break; // Exit the loop as further checks are unnecessary
            }
        }
        
        // Step 3: Return the maximum valid H-index found
        return ans;
    }
};

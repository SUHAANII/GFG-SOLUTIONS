question: Given an array of integers arr[] that is first strictly increasing and then maybe strictly decreasing, find the bitonic point, that is the maximum element in the array.
Bitonic Point is a point before which elements are strictly increasing and after which elements are strictly decreasing.

Note: It is guaranteed that the array contains exactly one bitonic point.

code:

// User function template for C++
class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to find the maximum element in a vector of integers
    int findMaximum(vector<int> &arr) {
        // Using the standard library function max_element to find the maximum value
        // `arr.begin()` gives an iterator to the start of the vector
        // `arr.end()` gives an iterator to the end of the vector
        // *max_element returns the maximum value found in the range [arr.begin(), arr.end())
        return *max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    }
};

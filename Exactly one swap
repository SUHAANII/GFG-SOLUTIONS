question: Given a string s, return the number of distinct strings that can be obtained by exactly one swap of two different indices (i < j).



code:

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to count the number of distinct strings that can be formed
    int countStrings(string &s) {
        // Get the length of the string
        int n = s.size(), ans = 0;
        // Variable to check if there are duplicate characters
        bool dup = false;
        // Map to store the frequency of each character in the string
        unordered_map<char, int> m;

        // Count the frequency of each character in the string
        for(char &i: s) {
            m[i]++;
        }

        // Iterate through each character in the string
        for(char &i: s) {
            // If the character appears more than once, set dup to true
            if(m[i] > 1) dup = true;
            // Add to the answer the number of characters not equal to the current character
            ans += n - m[i];
        }

        // Return the final count:
        // (ans / 2) gives the count of distinct pairs of characters,
        // and we add 1 if there were duplicates (to account for those cases)
        return (ans / 2) + dup;
    }
};

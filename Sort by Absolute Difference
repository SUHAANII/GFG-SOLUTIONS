question: You are given a number x and array arr[]. Your task is to rearrange the elements of the array according to the absolute difference with x, i.e., an element having minimum difference comes first, and so on.
Note: If two or more elements are at equal distances arrange them in the same sequence as in the given array.



code:

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to rearrange the array based on distance from x
    void rearrange(vector<int> &arr, int x) {
        // Use stable_sort to sort the array based on the distance from x
        stable_sort(arr.begin(), arr.end(), [&x](int a, int b) {
            // Compare the absolute distances of a and b from x
            return abs(a - x) < abs(b - x);
        });
        // After sorting, elements closer to x will come first in the array
    }
};
